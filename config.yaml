features_to_use: ['intensity', 'red', 'green' , 'blue' ,'nvi' ,'ndwi']  # features to be used for training

# -- (!) -- NOTE: features_to_use include only the additional features, meaning that x,y,z are always read from data, but they are not included in the channels
# -- (!) -------  this is because x,y,z are employed in the grids' features assignment (through nearest neighbour search), but are not assigned as features to the grids

# User options
models_save_dir: "models/saved/"   # Directory where the model is to be saved after training
save_model: true    # whether to save the model or to discard. Default is False, i.e., discard the trained model.
perform_inference_after_training : false    # whether to perform inference directly after training the model
raw_data_filepath: "data/raw/features_F.las"   # directory where raw data (to be eventually processed) is stored
load_model: false   # whether to use an already trained model for inference or not
load_model_filepath : "models/saved/mcnn_model_20240922_231624.pth"   # file path to the model to load for inference
