# Multi-Scale Convolutional Neural Network (MCNN) Training Project

This project contains the implementation of a Multi-Scale Convolutional Neural Network (MCNN) for processing point cloud data and generating corresponding images, based on the methodologies described in the article "Segmentation and Multi-Scale Convolutional Neural
Network-Based Classification of Airborne Laser
Scanner Data" (at https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/18/10/3347).

## Installation

To set up the environment and install the necessary dependencies, follow these steps:

1. **Clone this repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mcnn-training.git
   cd mcnn-training 
   ```

2. **Install the required packages**:

    `pip install -r requirements.txt`


## Usage

To train the MCNN model with default settings:

    python main.py

To train the MCNN model with custom setting you can use the argument parser specify relevant command line arguments. The possible commands are:

- `--batch size`  specifies batch size for training
- `--epochs` specifies the number of training epochs
- `--patience` specifies the number of epochs to wait for an improvement in validation loss before early stopping
- `--learning_rate` specifies the learning rate for the optimizer
- `--learning_rate_decay_epochs` specifies the epochs interval to decay learning rate 
- `--learning_rate_decay_gamma` specifies the learning rate decay factor
- `--save_dir` specifies the directory to save trained models
